> “Tell me and I forget.  Teach me and I remember.  Involve me and I learn.”
— Benjamin Franklin

I am an optimistic cs student who loves this shit and `Competitive Programming`. A passionate Full Stack Software Developer 🚀 having an experience of building Web and Mobile applications with `JavaScript / Reactjs / Nodejs / Flutter / Flask / Shell` and some other cool libraries and frameworks.

In the field of `AI` I have also dipped my hand. The most fun thing in this aspect is its challenging and helps us to see the world in a new perspective.
